I've been messing around with more config stuff lately so I created a fresh repo for my `~/.config/`. 

Someone showed me [aerospace](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace) and I'm absolutely in love with it. 
I still don't regularly use vim but I use vim motions in vscode so I'm much more comfortable with them then I was 3 months ago.
Sketchybar is the most recent addition to the config crew. I don't have much going on in there other than a basic setup to work with aerospace.

At this point things feel pretty nicely set up. Language servers are working and file navigation is smooth. Still getting used to using vim and when I'm at work I typically start on vim but end up switching to vscode to aovid the little things that still slow me down.

I'd like to make updates like this a regular thing to encourage more mindful updates.
